Here starts a new beginning for pouring my thoughts onto whoever decides to read my blog posts. I started blogging on Tumblr sometime last year, and got some use out of it. However, I soon started to feel the need for a different platform. A platform that is much more versatile, a platform that is entirely within my control. So I decided to use GitHub. It may seem strange to use GitHub as a platform for a personal blog, but this is just one of the many things I plan to use it for. For the most part, I will be using it as intended.

As for what this switch means, I’m not really sure. I may be posting more often, I may be posting about other things as well. Who knows. For now though, I don’t plan on going back, and I will make sure to let this know for the readers of my old blog.
