It's been a long time since I actually felt the need to write anything. I don't know whether that's good or bad though. I feel like considering the things that happened in the last 8 months, that must be good. After all, I've been using my blog as the main platform for sharing my thoughts and feelings. And it's not like I don't have anything to share anymore, it's more so the fact that I found a different place for it. I found a place where people actually see what I write and listen. And that feels wonderful. But at the same time, I can't help but feel that this has made me much less introspective in general. If I can readily share my thoughts with people who will listen whenever I want to, and there's no need to sit on them, their introspective aspect gets lost entirely.

There are several moments and timeframes in my past that I like to look back on from time to time, be it a positive or negative memory. I don't really personally believe in letting the negative aspects of my past get to me. I've always managed to look past that and learn from them, making them as positive of an experience as possible. Because of this, I feel like what I've been going through lately - while not having much substance at all, especially nowadays - doesn't really have this kind of value associated with it.

Obviously, I don't mean to discredit basically everything that happened to me during this entire year so far. I just feel like this period of my life is not going to be as influential as I originally thought, even though it contains some of the greatest memories I'll ever have.

Ultimately, I don't know what this really means. Maybe it's just something different that I'll just get used to over time. Maybe it really is just not that important in the whole scheme of things. I suppose we'll see.
